# Project — *“Rider Classes: A Statistical Deep Dive into Cycling Performance”*

This project began with a simple curiosity — do different types of cyclists truly perform differently across the diverse terrains of a multi-stage tour? What followed was a full-scale statistical expedition that combined intuition, rigor, and a touch of obsession. Using real-world performance data from professional riders, this analysis dissects every layer of variation — from the raw grind of mountain stages to the all-out bursts on the flats. The workflow goes beyond standard academic analysis: it dynamically chooses the right tests based on data behavior (ANOVA vs. Kruskal–Wallis), dives into post-hoc comparisons with Dunn’s tests, and models rider-specific variance using a linear mixed-effects framework. Each result is not just tabulated, but visualized — through violin, raincloud, and correlation heatmaps that make the statistics breathe. The entire pipeline is fully automated: one script builds every table, figure, and even a ready-to-submit PDF report, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

The workflow goes beyond standard academic analysis: it dynamically chooses the right tests based on data behavior (**ANOVA vs. Kruskal–Wallis**), dives into post-hoc comparisons with **Dunn’s tests**, and models rider-specific variance using a **linear mixed-effects framework**. Each result is not just tabulated, but *visualized* — through violin, raincloud, and correlation heatmaps that make the statistics breathe. 
The entire pipeline is **fully automated** — one script builds every table, figure, and even a ready-to-submit PDF report, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.  
> It’s a *data story told with discipline and personality.*  
> Where others stop at p-values, this project translates patterns into insights, balancing mathematical depth with narrative clarity.  
It represents not just technical skill, but a mindset: **to question, to quantify, and to make every dataset tell the truth it hides.**
